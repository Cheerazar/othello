## Othello

To get started with this app:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
1. Run the command `yarn install` from the root of the project
1. Run the command `yarn start` from the root of the project to start the server and automatically launch a tab in your browser.

Things that are next on my list to do are:

1. Add the flip mechanic in when placing a piece
1. Only allow valid moves to be played
1. Add additional styling to create a better user experience
1. Add tests for components
1. Serve on a service like Heroku to allow people to play the game online and not need to manually install the project themselves
